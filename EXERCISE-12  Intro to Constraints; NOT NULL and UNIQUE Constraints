1.   What is a “constraint” as it relates to data integrity?

Database can be as reliable as the data in it, and database rules are implemented as Constraint to maintain data integrity. 
For example these constraints may prohibit deletion of a table or some row when insertion, updation or deletion is executed. Type of constraints:
    · PRIMARY KEY Constraint
    · UNIQUE Constraint
    · FOREIGN KEY Constraint
    · CHECK Constraint with condition applied on the column/columns (they work at row level)
    · NOT NULL Constraint (implemented at row level using special CHECK Constraint having condition IS NOT NULL for single column)


2.   What are the limitations of constraints that may be applied at the column level and at the table level?

    · Constraints referring to more than one column are defined at Table Level
    · NOT NULL constraint must be defined at column level as per ANSI/ISO SQL standard.
    · If word CONSTRAINT is used in a CREATE TABLE statement, I must specify constraint name. Also, that is why, Table level constraint must be user-named.


3.  Why is it important to give meaningful names to constraints?

    · If a constraint is violated in a SQL statement execution, it is easy to identify the cause with user-named constraints.
    · It is easy to alter names/drop constraint.
    · Handling production issues may be faster with user-named constraints


 6.  Write the CREATE TABLE statement for the Global Fast Foods locations table to define the constraints at the column level.

CREATE TABLE  f_global_locations
( id NUMBER(6,0) CONSTRAINT f_gln_id_pk PRIMARY KEY ,
name VARCHAR2(50),
date_opened DATE CONSTRAINT f_gln_dt_opened_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
address VARCHAR2(50) CONSTRAINT f_gln_add_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
city VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT f_gln_city_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
zip_postal_code VARCHAR2(12),
phone VARCHAR2(20),
email VARCHAR2(75) CONSTRAINT f_gln_email_uk UNIQUE,
manager_id NUMBER(6,0),
emergency_contact VARCHAR2(20)
);


8.  Execute a DESCRIBE command to view the Table Summary information.

DESCRIBE f_global_locations;


9.  Rewrite the CREATE TABLE statement for the Global Fast Foods locations table to define the UNIQUE constraints at the table level. Do not execute this statement.

CREATE TABLE  f_global_locations
( id NUMBER(6,0) CONSTRAINT f_gln_id_pk PRIMARY KEY ,
name VARCHAR2(50),
date_opened DATE CONSTRAINT f_gln_dt_opened_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
address VARCHAR2(50) CONSTRAINT f_gln_add_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
city VARCHAR2(30)  CONSTRAINT f_gln_city_nn NOT NULL ENABLE,
zip_postal_code VARCHAR2(12),
phone VARCHAR2(20),
email VARCHAR2(75) ,
manager_id NUMBER(6,0),
emergency_contact VARCHAR2(20),
 CONSTRAINT f_gln_email_uk UNIQUE(email)

);
